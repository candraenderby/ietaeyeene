                            <p>Crashlands - экшн-приключенческая ролевая 2D игра с элементами выживания и открытым миром разработанная и выпущенная студией Butterscotch Shenanigans. The Crashlands Wiki needs sooo much help, but I've never helped build one before so I don't want to do it wrong! Also I don't have a ton of hours to pour into it! http://crashlands.gamepedia.com/Crashlands_Wiki. Игровой цикл (англ. gameplay loop, также англ. core gameplay loop) — принцип, согласно которому геймдизайнеры задают главный элемент игровой механики, который определяет фундаментальный опыт игрока. 
The Official Crashlands Wiki is an encyclopedia database that contains everything you need to know about the rogue-like, alien crawling RPG from Butterscotch Shenanigans. Check out the guides and walkthroughs, find quest and item information, with descriptions, strategies So over on the Crashlands Wiki discord (https://discordapp.com/channels/120295792266182656/276548174460616716), one of the devs posted a zip file containing an updated compendium of the game's images and data for creatures, items, stats, etc. Included in this was a map of all the prerequisites for each and every quest. But, as you can see (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwM4_s1NDsNHaGl4QW9GbnhVQ2s/view), it's a total mess: Lines overlapping text, no way to tell where chains start Общая информация В Crashlands работает незыблемое правило: всё, что вы можете убить, можете, также, приручить. Общая информация В Crashlands вы играете за героя по имени Flux Dabes, галактического доставщика посылок. 
Внимание! Раздел нуждается в Вашей помощи! Вы можете предложить свою информацию по игре, нажав редактировать и когда ваш вклад пройдет проверку модератором получить за это бонусы. Сюжет Сюжет игры начинается с того, что космический корабль Flux (протагониста) терпит крушение на планете Woanope.

I don't blame all the people posting that question, over and over, mobile gaming is tough, the Play Store is near impossible to sift through 
Users had many doubts about great Android Action RPGs. I see a thread called "Recommend me an Action RPG" everytime I enter here (not "everytime",but you know what I'm saying). So,here I came with this idea : let's create a list of well made Action RPGs? The list will be separated in: , Recommended and Not tested yet or not tested enough  Simple as that.But I can add another categories later. People here can discuss and recommend games,just like me.
